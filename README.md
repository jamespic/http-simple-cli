http-simple-cli
===============

A simple CLI to make HTTP requests using the stdlib http.client module.

The main goal is to make it possible to make simple http requests from inside containers,
for example for health checks, without having to install any OS dependencies (and having
to deal with security alerts for those OS dependencies).
